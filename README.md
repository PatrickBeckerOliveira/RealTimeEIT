# RealTimeEIT

Modified files from liubenyuan/pyeit repository.
The main ideia was to change examples/eit_external_mesh.py so it would update the generated graphs every time a variation in the conductivity values happened.
However I was unable to create a ply file that could update the data related to the conductivity values, so instead I used a randomized array to update the graph.
